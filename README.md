Hi there I'm xmlsax.



This a program I wrote for second security. (However, it's not so secure in Windows 8 and later and I haven't tested it in linux and macosx.)



The default password is in the source ("DefaultPassword"). You can change the source code to make it search for the password in linux and macosx, or to set the default password to other value.
